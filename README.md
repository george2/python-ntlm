"Python library that provides NTLM support, including an authentication
handler for urllib2"

This is a fork of the original Google code project that better suits my
needs. Specifically, it is designed for use with a REST API (with which
it is not possible to use urllib2). Note that this means I have removed
the "authentication handler for urllib2."
